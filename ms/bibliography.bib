However, it is an often neglected fact that these models may be scoring high on accuracy for the wrong reasons. In this paper, we present a practical impact analysis of enabling model transparency by various presentation forms. For this purpose, we developed an environment that empowers non-computer scientists to become practicing data scientists in their own research field. We demonstrate the gradually increasing understanding of journalism historians through a real-world use case study on automatic genre classification of newspaper articles. This study is a first step towards trusted usage of machine learning pipelines in a responsible way.},

This article examines this claim by testing the existence of modernity, civilization and Europe as a conceptual `trinity' by using digital history techniques. Word frequencies, collocations and word embeddings are employed to analyze four Dutch newspapers (Algemeen Handelsblad, Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant, De Telegraaf, De Leeuwarder Courant) spanning the period 1840\textendash{}1990. It transpires that semantic relations between the three elements are hardly visible; in so far as they appear, they hardly constitute a close-knit `trinity'. Alternating combinations among the three components were more significant than direct connections between all three, while `the West' was more central than Europe. These findings suggest that popular media like newspapers have a different take on culturalpolitical concepts than writings by the intellectual elite.},

  publisher = {{Harvard University Press}},
  address = {{Cambridge}},
  abstract = {Some say it's simply information, mirroring the world. Others believe it's propaganda, promoting a partisan view. But news, Michael Schudson tells us, is really both and neither; it is a form of culture, complete with its own literary and social conventions and powerful in ways far more subtle and complex than its many critics might suspect. A penetrating look into this culture, The Power of News offers a compelling view of the news media's emergence as a central institution of modern society, a key repository of common knowledge and cultural authority.One of our foremost writers on journalism and mass communication, Schudson shows us the news evolving in concert with American democracy and industry, subject to the social forces that shape the culture at large. He excavates the origins of contemporary journalistic practices, including the interview, the summary lead, the preoccupation with the presidency, and the ironic and detached stance of the reporter toward the political world. His book explodes certain myths perpetuated by both journalists and critics. The press, for instance, did not bring about the Spanish-American War or bring down Richard Nixon; TV did not decide the Kennedy-Nixon debates or turn the public against the Vietnam War.Then what does the news do? True to their calling, the media mediate, as Schudson demonstrates. He analyzes how the news, by making knowledge public, actually changes the character of knowledge and allows people to act on that knowledge in new and significant ways. He brings to bear a wealth of historical scholarship and a keen sense for the apt questions about the production, meaning, and reception of news today.},

  author = {Marshall, Margaret},
  year = {1995},
  publisher = {{University of Michigan Press}},
  address = {{Ann Arbor}},
  abstract = {Margaret J. Marshall's analysis employs a range of contemporary theorists from Bakhtin to Foucault and draws on a number of disciplinary perspectives, including law, history, and ethnography, where scholars have been examining discursive practices and where rhetoric is understood to be a means of examining cultural conceptions and embedded ideologies. Through these lenses she examines four influential and popular texts of the 1890s that serve to illuminate current public debates on education: Joseph Mayer Rice's articles in Forum, a well-respected magazine; Matthew Arnold's introduction to a government report; W. E. B. Du Bois's "A Negro Schoolmaster in the New South;" and Jane Addams's "A Function of the Social Settlement." Neither a history of education nor a typical literary analysis of the texts in question, this book considers the rhetorical stance of authors, the constitution of audience and subject, and the use of references and narratives as devices of authority.Taken together, these texts reveal the complicated public discussion of education in the 1890s - a period of transformation in culture, schooling, and the organization of knowledge. Moreover, they reveal the rhetorical structure of many of the questions Americans ask about education today: who should be educated, by whom, for what purposes, using what methods or materials? What of the past should we pass on to the future, and how?Contesting Cultural Rhetorics will be useful to readers interested in the history of education and nineteenth-century popular culture, as well as those involved in current debates on education and public policy.},

Events such as the First World War, the post-war revival of institutionalized internationalism and the increasing geopolitical tensions during the Interwar Period are likely to impact the degree of internationalism found in socialism. In this paper, we use digital tools to search for expressions of `banal' internationalism and cosmopolitanism in Belgian socialist discourse from 1885 until 1940 by text mining two socialist newspapers: the French journal Le Peuple and the Dutch Vooruit. The goal is to highlight some of the difficulties encountered in collecting and processing the relevant data, and to showcase two potential analyses once the data has been acquired and prepared: a study of the most frequent locations throughout time via Named-entity recognition (NER) and a collocation analysis to study international and cosmopolitan sentiments.},

The strategy is controversial, and this article adds an additional reason to be cautious about adopting it. Specifically, consumers increasingly consume brands not for the products they designate but for the affiliation with the brands themselves. Since the benefits of source protection depend upon a consumer's desire to have a product actually from that source community, if consumers care more about the brand designation than the actual source, then those benefits will be more difficult to realize. In such an environment there would be tremendous pressure both to produce products that conform to (often exoticized) western images of cultures and to create property rights in the culture itself, empowering elites to further marginalize and suppress dissenting views.},
